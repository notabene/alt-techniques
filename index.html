    <section>
      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>The HTML <code>alt</code> attribute can be placed on any
	<code>img</code> element.
	Its content should provide
	a short textual description of the image.
	Such descriptions help users who for any
	reason are unable to view the images.
	They are also used by software processing HTML documents,
	such as Web search engines and in-page user agent searches.</p>
	<p>Except where otherwise specified the <code>alt</code> attribute MUST be specified on
	every <code>img</code> element and MUST NOT be empty.
	The value SHOULD be an appropriate functional replacement for the image.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="alt">Providing text to act as an alternative for images</h2>
      <p>The <code>alt</code> attribute is an essential part of making accessible
	documents as well as providing for text-based search engines
	and other consumers of HTML.  Text such as the content of
	<code>alt</code> attributes intended to be used when images are
	unavailable is known as
	alternative text,
	and is an instance of a more general class of
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#text-altdef">Text alternatives</a> [[WCAG20]],
	a primary way of making visual information accessible.
	Text alternatives allow the information to be rendered
	in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents.
	For example,
	a person who cannot see a picture
	can have the <a>text alternative</a> read aloud using synthesized speech.
      </p>


      <p>
	Authors use text alternatives to provide the same information
	(or in many cases functionality) to people who cannot see an image.
	The function of an image depends on its context: a company logo, for
	example, might be part of identity branding on a home page
	but function as a navigation icon on other pages.
	Thus, the same image may need different
	<code>alt</code> text in different contexts.
	See also the <code>longdesc</code> attribute [[HTML-LONGDESC]] for
	a way to link to external text alternatives and image descriptions.
      </p>

      <p>
	The following sections give some principles for writing text alternatives
	with the <code>alt</code> attribute and suggest when to use the <code>longdesc</code>
	attribute to provide more detail.
	Additional guidance, techniques, and examples
	are available in <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/alt/">Resources on Alternative Text for Images</a>.</p>

       <section>
       <h3 id="alt-technical-constraints">Technical Constraints</h3>

	 <p>Because <code>alt</code> is an HTML attribute there are some restrictions on
	   what it can contain and how it can be used:</p>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-restrict-lang">Language of Alternate Text</h4>
	   <p>The language of the attribute value cannot be marked as being
	     different from that of the image element itself. This is not usually
	     a problem in practice unless the image element was supplied by
	     automated language-based document assembly; use the
	     <code>lang</code> (and for the XML syntax the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute)
	     to mark the language of the alternate text if it differs from that of
	     the surrounding text.</p>
	 </section>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-restrict-plaintext">Sub-elements not available in Alternate Text</h4>
	   <p>Attributes are plain text and cannot contain sub-elements.
	   In particular this also means that fragments of MathML or SVG
	   cannot be included in an <code>alt</code> attribute value, and
	   that emphasis cannot be used.</p>
	  </section>

	  <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-restrict-overflow">Effective Length Limits on Alternate Text</h4>
	   <p>The value of the <code>alt</code> attribute will generally be
	     rendered by an HTML user agent as replacement text
	     in place of a broken or unavailable
	     image, or if image display is disabled, or in a text-mode browser.
	     The replacement text will usually be rendered in the space reserved
	     for the image. If the text does not fit in the available space,
	     some user agents will truncate the text and others might not
	     display the text at all, reducing accessibility and usability
	     of the document for sighted users in the case that images were
	     not available.</p>
	   <p>In at least some user agents the CSS <code>overflow</code> property
	     may be used to allow the alternate text to extend outside
	     the width and height allocated for the <code>img</code> element.</p>
	   <p class="ednote">Why are we mentioning something that only works in some
	     user agents?  I would strike this sentence - we should not be recommending
	     techniquies that don't work portably.</p>
	  </section>

	  <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-restrict-no-difference">No differentiation from surrounding text</h4>
	   <p>Text readers will generally read out the value of the
	     <code>alt</code> attribute
	     every time it is encountered, and may or may not provide the
	     user with a way to skip to the end of the alternate text and
	     to carry on reading out the document just after the image element.
	     This means that documents should not contain overly
	     burdensome alternate text even if it might fit in the available
	     space.</p>

	   <p>For visual differentiation, CSS styles such as
	     <code>color</code> can be applied to the <code>img</code> element.</p>

	   <p>Text that is for use as an alternative to an image but that
	     contains formatting or markup (e.g., tables or equations)
	     needs to be made available separately as described in the next
	     section,
	     <a href="#principles-for-providing-text-alternatives">Principles for
	       providing text alternatives</a>. In this case a short <a>text
	     alternative</a> (e.g., <code>Maxwell's Equations</code>) SHOULD be
	     used in the <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>

	     <p>The
	     <code>alt</code> attribute may be subject to XML &ldquo;attribute
	     value normalization&rdquo; if the document is served as XML or
	     processed by XML tools.
	     In particular this normalization removes leading and trailing
	     ASCII whitespace. Non-breaking spaces such as &amp;#160; are
	     not subject to normalization and can be used when concatenating
	     the <code>alt</code> text value to surrounding text might cause
	     unacceptable word joining.</p>
	  </section>

       </section>

       <section>
       <h3 id="principles-for-providing-text-alternatives">Principles For
	 Providing Text Alternatives</h3>

	 <p>Even though there are restrictions on its value, the
	   <code>alt</code> attribute is still needed in order to make
	   documents properly accessible.
	   This section describes general principles for authors and
	   developers to use when considering the use of the
	   <code>alt</code> attribute, the
	   <code>longdesc</code> attribute, and also the newer
	   ARIA <code>described-by</code> and <code>described-at</code>
	   attributes. [[WAI-ARIA]]</p>
	 <p class="ednote">We mention described-at here, but it is 1) not approved and 2) we
	   don't point that out until much later in the document.  We should probably
	   remove this reference or at least point to the information about its
	   status.</p>

	 <p class="note">The Web Accessibility Initiative provides
	   <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/">An
	    fDecision Tree</a> to help authors decide what to put
	   into an <code>alt</code> attribute value.</p>

	 <h4 id="alt-guideline-purpose">Functional images: State the Purpose</h4>
	 <p>Where an image has a function (e.g., a button to press) or serves
	   a clear purpose such as identifying the maker of a page by a company
	   logo, be direct and simply give the purpose (e.g., <q>Make Payment</q>
	   or <q>W3C Logo</q>).</p>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-guideline-characters">Images As Text: Give the text</h4>
	   <p>If an image is used to stand for a special character, emoji, gaiji,
	     itaiji, emoticon, or text in an unusual font, the <a>alt text</a> should
	     simply be the text that is on the image, or a textual equivalent
	     such as <code>:-)</code> for a smiling face.</p>
	   <p class="note">In many cases Web fonts can be used instead of images,
	     and, provided that the fonts are correctly encoded and that the
	     characters represented are in Unicode, user agents that do not use
	     the fonts will still render the correct text.</p>
	 </section>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-guideline-mathematics">Images of Equations and Tables</h4>
	   <p>Recommended practice is to mark up mathematical equations
	     with MathML. If this is not possible, sometimes a picture
	     of an equation is used. Similarly even complex tables can
	     usually be marked up in HTML directly, but sometimes a
	     picture is used instead.  In these and similar cases the
	     <code>alt</code> attribute should be given a value such as <q>Equation 7</q>
	     or <q>Table of wandering monsters by level</q>.
	     Since people seeing the image would not want to read the
	     same content in two different forms, the information in the
	     equation or table picture should then be presented in an
	     external document, pointed to with a URI as the value of the
	     <code>longdesc</code> attribute, for example
	     <code>longdesc</code> <code>=</code> <code>"equation007.html"</code>.</p>
	 </section>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-guideline-charts-and-diagrams">Charts and Diagrams</h4>
	   <p>It is often possible to represent charts, diagrams, and other
	     explanatory sorts of pictures using [[SVG]]. This does not automatically
	     make such pictures accessible, but different mechanisms then
	     become available for embedding <a>text alternatives</a> in the SVG images.</p>
	   <p>If SVG is for some reason not used then the same considerations
	     as for <a href="#alt-guideline-mathematics">images of equations and
	       tables</a>
	     generally apply. A description of a diagram, however, may need to
	     include information about the presentation as well as the
	     information.  For example, a government report in an archival
	     format might mention the colors used in a bar chart
	     in order to facilitate subsequent discussions.</p>
	 </section>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-guidelines-simple-images">Simple Images</h4>
	   <p>Where an image or diagram can be described adequately
	     with a short piece of plain text that would easily fit
	     in the space otherwise occupied by the image,
	     that text should be used for the text alternative.</p>
	 </section>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-guidelines-decorative">Decorative and Pieced Images</h4>
	   <p>If an image is purely decorative, it is not necessary to give
	     it <a>alt text</a>; use an empty value for the
	     <code>alt</code> attribute.
	     If the image separates words of text an alternative text
	     of an encoded single space (e.g., <code>alt="&#20;"</code>) might be appropriate.</p>
	   <p>When multiple images are placed together, for
	     example to make up a frame or border or when a
	     complex image is split into smaller images, only
	     the first image should normally have explanatory
	     text, in order to avoid tedious repetition from
	     a screen reader.</p>

	<h3 id="graphical-representations:-charts,-diagrams,-graphs,-maps,-illustrations">Graphical Representations: Charts, diagrams, graphs, maps, illustrations</h3>
	<p>Readers can benefit when content is presented in graphical form, for example as a flowchart, a diagram, a graph, or a map showing directions.
	  People unable to see the image for any reason will
	  need the information provided in another form.</p>
	<p>Diagrams often convey a lot of information. This means that
	  a textual alternative may be quite lengthy.  The content of the
	  <code>alt</code> attribute is in general limited to the amount
	  of text that will fit in the space normally occupied by
	  the image.  In addition, it may be tedious for someone
	  listening to an audio rendition of a Web page to have to skip
	  over a lengthy description each time they reach the diagram.</p>
	<p>An appropriate technique, then, is to have a short description
	  in the <code>alt</code> attribute, such as
	  <code>bar chart of product sales by region</code>, and
	  to link to a longer image description.</p>
	<p>An <em>image description</em> in this context is text,
	  whether embedded in the main document or elsewhere, that
	  would enable a reader to have a good idea of what the image
	  looks like. This is different from an
	  <em>alternate representation</em> in that, for example,
	  it might mention that a pie chart is circular or that the
	  items in a bar chart are horizontal rows, and should mention
	  any significant colors. Such a description can enable people
	  to participate in conversations about the image, or to
	  answer examination questions that might rely on the
	  way the information is represented and not just the underlying
	  data.</p>

      <h4>Using the <code>alt</code> attribute with an external image description</h4>
	<p>An external image description is just another document, normally
	in HTML, that describes an image.
	You should consider using an external image description if
	one of more of the following applies:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The description would not interest people able
	  to see the image itself.</li>
	  <li>The description might be lengthy enough to annoy people
	  who can see the image, or confuse people reading the page.</li>
	  <li>The description is provided by a third party, for example
	  for diagrams in examination questions.</li>
	</ul>

      <h4>Using the <code>alt</code> attribute with an associated text alternative</h4>
      <p>A <a>text alternative</a> presents the same essential information
      as a diagram or illustration but in a text format accessible
      in cases where the image is not seen or used. It is normally contained
      in the same document as the image.
      You should supply a <a>text alternative</a> in addition to the <code>alt</code> attribute
	  in these circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
	  <li>The information takes more than a few words to describe but
	  is still of use to someone who can see the image.</li>
	  <li>A user might reasonably want to select the text alternative, or
	  to find it with a browser search function, regardless of whether
	  the image is displayed.</li>
	  <li>The <a>text alternative</a> requires structured markup such as MathML,
	  tables, emphasis, multiple paragraphs, links, or Japanese ruby annotations.
	  Attributes such as <code>alt</code> cannot contain elements.</li>
	  <li>The <a>text alternative</a> is not in the same language
	  as the main document.
	  Attributes such as <code>alt</code> cannot be marked with <code>xml:lang</code> for
	  language.</li>
      </ul>

    <div name="overlapping-circles">
      <p>The following example is taken from a (fictional)
      examination question on simple color theory.
      Someone unable to see the image would need to know that the
      two circles are colored red and blue respectively,
      and that the white area is where the circles overlap.
      Someone able to see the image would not want to waste time
      in an exam context reading such a description. In addition,
      the description is too long for an <code>alt</code> attribute
      value.</p>
      <p>To meet the needs both of users who see the image an
      users who don't, an image description is provided separately.
      In some contexts this could be included in the same HTML document
      as the examination question
      but image descriptions for educational purposes are often provided
      by third parties and may be more easily managed as a separate file.
      In addition browsers used by people with accessibility needs might
      not have JavaScript available or enabled.
      In this example the widely-supported <code>longdesc</code> attribute
      is used to point to an external description;
      a more general attribute to point to external descriptions,
      <code>aria-describedat</code>, has been proposed but is not
      yet (2015) widely supported.</p>
      <p class="ednote">Is there really a reason to say whether longdesc is widely
        supported or not?  Longdesc is part of HTML5 so we can safely recommend
        its use.  We don't need to point out that it is widely supported.  It has been
        in HTML for ~20 years - Shane</p>

      <h4>Using the <code>alt</code> attribute with an associated text alternative</h4>
      <p>You should consider supplying a <a>text alternative</a> in addition to the <code>alt</code> attribute
	  in these circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
	  <li>The <a>text alternative</a> is more than a few words long, or is complex
	  or detailed.</li>
	  <li>A user might reasonably want to select the text alternative, or
	  to find it with a browser search function.</li>
	  <li>The <a>text alternative</a> requires structured markup such as MathML,
	  emphasis, multiple paragraphs, links, or Japanese ruby annotations.
	  Attributes such as <code>alt</code> cannot contain elements.</li>
	  <li>The <a>text alternative</a> might need to be translated into other
	  languages, or is not in the same language as the main document.
	  Attributes such as <code>alt</code> cannot be marked with xml:lang for
	  language.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although the <code>alt</code> attribute is essential to enable someone to understand
	  which image was not rendered, it should not be relied on to convey
	  detailed content.</p>

        <p>Here's an example of a flowchart image with a short <a>text alternative</a>     included in the <code>alt</code> attribute.
           In this case the <a>text alternative</a> is a description of the link target     as the image is the sole content of a link. The link points to a description (within the same document) of the     process represented in the flowchart.</p>

   <h3 id="images-of-text">Images of text</h3>
      <p>Sometimes an image contains only text, and the purpose of the image     is to display text  using visual effects and/or fonts.  It is <em>strongly</em> recommended that text styled using CSS be used, but if this is not possible, provide     the same text in the <code>alt</code> attribute as is in the image.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>This example shows an image of the text "Get Happy!" written in a fancy multi colored freehand style.     The image makes up the content of a heading. In this case the <a>text alternative</a> for the image is "Get Happy!".</p>
        <p><img alt="Get Happy!" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/text.png" height="77" width="275"></p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img src="gethappy.gif" <mark>alt="Get Happy!"</mark>&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
      </div>
      <p>When an image is used to represent a character that cannot otherwise be represented in Unicode (e.g., gaiji, itaiji, or new characters such as novel currency symbols) the <a>text alternative</a>    should be a more conventional way of writing the same thing (e.g., using the phonetic hiragana or    katakana to give the character's pronunciation).</p>
      <p>An image should not be used if Unicode characters would serve an identical purpose. Only when    the text cannot be directly represented using Unicode (e.g., because of decorations or because the character is not in the Unicode character set) would an image be    appropriate. If necessary Web fonts can be used to supply specific representations for
      Unicode characters. This is preferable to the use of images because a text reader
      or search engine can process the Unicode character directly.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>An illuminated manuscript might use ornate forms for some of its letters. The <a>text alternative</a> in     such a situation is just the character that the image represents.</p>
        <p><img alt="O" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/fancyO.png" height="32" width="24">nce upon a time and a long long time ago...</p>

      <p>In many cases an image is actually just supplementary &emdash; its presence merely reinforces the    surrounding text. In these cases, the <code>alt</code> attribute must be present but its value MUST be the empty string.</p>
      <p>In general, an image falls into this category if removing the image doesn't make the page any    less useful, but including the image makes it a lot easier for users of visual browsers to    understand the concept.</p>

        <p>It is not always easy to write a useful <a>text alternative</a> for an image. Another option is to provide a link to a     description or further information about the image when one is available. </p>

In such cases, always provide a <a>text alternative</a> for the image using the <code>alt</code> attribute.
<div class="example">
  <p>Consider the following image which is a map of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katoomba,_New_South_Wales">Katoomba</a>,      it has 2 interactive regions corresponding to the areas of North and South Katoomba:</p>

  <h3 id="captcha-images">CAPTCHA Images</h3>
<p>CAPTCHA stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart".    CAPTCHA images are used for security purposes to confirm that content is being accessed by a person    rather than a computer. This authentication is done through visual verification of an image. CAPTCHA     typically presents an image with characters or words in it that the user is to re-type. The image is     usually distorted and has some noise applied to it to make the characters difficult to read.</p>
<p>To improve the accessibility of CAPTCHA provide text alternatives   that identify and describe the purpose of the image, and provide   alternative     forms of the CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory   perception. For instance provide     an audio alternative along with the visual image. Place the audio   option right next to the visual one.     This helps but is still problematic for people without sound cards,   the deaf-blind, and some people with limited hearing.     Another method is to include a form that asks a question along with   the visual image. This helps but can be     problematic for people with cognitive impairments.</p>
<p class="warning">It is strongly recommended that alternatives to CAPTCHA be used, as all forms of CAPTCHA introduce     unacceptable barriers to entry for users with disabilities. For further information, see [[TURINGTEST]].</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>This example shows a CAPTCHA test which uses a distorted image of text. The <a>text alternative</a> in the     <code>alt</code> attribute provides instructions for a user in the case where she cannot access the image content. </p>
  <p><img alt="captcha containing the words 'aides' and 'sprucest'. The letters are distorted and the color of the letters and background is partially inverted," src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/captcha.png" height="60" width="270"></p>

  <h3 id="native">Native HTML methods</h3>

    <h3 id="altmethod">The img element <code>alt</code> attribute</h3>
    <p>The primary method for providing text alternatives for images is by including text in the img element <code>alt</code> attribute.  In graphical   browsers the content of the <code>alt</code> attribute is typically displayed along with an indication (bordered area and/or an image icon) of the presence of an image when the image is not displayed, because the user has disabled image display or the image source information is incorrect. Assistive technologies such as screen readers will typically announce the presence of an image followed by the <code>alt</code> attribute content. Text based browsers  may display the <code>alt</code> attribute content  in brackets or in  different colored text or as the content of a link to the image or as text without any indication of the image or  prefixed with an indication of the image.</p>

      <p>The answer to this question depends on the content of the image and the context the image is being used in:</p>
      <UL>
        <LI>When an image contains too much information to use the <code>alt</code> attribute as a container for a text alternative, the <code>alt</code> attribute content can be a label for the image.

        <LI>When an image is used to represent text and it is the author's intent that the purpose of using an image of text is to achieve a visual style, the <code>alt</code> attribute content SHOULD be considered as a replacement for the image. </LI>
	<LI>When an image is decorative and it is the author's intent that it not convey any information, an <a>empty <code>alt</code> attribute</a> SHOULD be considered as an indication that the image can be safely ignored. </LI>
	<LI>When it is the author's intent that the image is not to be seen by users, an <a>empty <code>alt</code> attribute</a> SHOULD be considered as an indication that the image can be safely ignored.</LI>
	<LI>When an image is immediately preceded or followed by a <a>text alternative</a> and the image and the <a>text alternative</a> are not complex in nature, an <a>empty <code>alt</code> attribute</a> SHOULD be considered as an indication that the image can be safely ignored.</LI>

      <UL>
	      <LI>An image is contained within a <code>figure</code> element and has an associated caption provided using the <code>figcaption</code> element. Using an <a>empty <code>alt</code> attribute</a> hides an image from some users.

	      <LI>An image contains relevant information not available in the same document as text. Using an <a>empty <code>alt</code> attribute</a> hides an image from some users. In order to have the possibility of interrogating the image, the image must be discoverable.</LI>
	      <LI>An image contains relevant information,  an alternative interpretation of which is available in the same document as structured text. Using an <a>empty <code>alt</code> attribute</a> hides an image from some users, which is incorrect. The image is not meaningless, it  contains information which a range of users could interpret with the  aid of the short <a>text alternative</a> and longer description. It also provides a text  alternative for users who have images turned off in their browsers, so  they can load and view the image if they wish. If an <a>empty <code>alt</code> attribute</a> is present  there may be no indication that an image is present. Furthermore if a description of an image is provided in a document, a <a>programmatic association</a> between the image and the descriptive text is required.

      <h5>How long should an <code>alt</code> text be?</h5>
      <p>While there are <strong>no definitive right or wrong lengths</strong> for text alternatives provided using the img element's <code>alt</code> attribute, the general consensus is that if the <a>text alternative</a> is longer 30-50 words (2 to 3 sentences), it should not be considered a short <a>text alternative</a> and should not be presented using the <code>alt</code> attribute. Refer to the section - <a href="#graphical-representations-charts-diagrams-graphs-maps-illustrations">Graphical Representations: Charts, diagrams, graphs, maps, illustrations</a> for example methods of providing longer text alternatives for images.</p>
      <p class="note">A <a>text alternative</a> provided using the <code>alt</code> attribute is exposed to screen reader users as a text string, generally announced as a chunk, and cannot be structured into paragraphs or have other markup added to aid comprehension. It also cannot usually be interrupted, so brevity can be of considerable value.</p>

  <h2 id="gj">Notes on use of Gaiji</h2>
  <p>Gaiji is a term meaning "external characters".  In general, this means characters that are not represented in existing Japanese
  encoding systems such as [[UNICODE]].</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When gaiji is used as a "hack" to display a character that is adequately represented by a real Unicode character, the recommended practice is to remove the gaiji image and just use the Unicode character.
    </li>
    <li>When gaiji is used to display a character that is not available in a particular font, the alternative text should be the Unicode character.
    </li>
    <li>When gaiji is used to represent a graphical image similar to those displaying emoji, use a short description of the image's content (e.g. "thumbs up", "sunrise", or "smiling woman").
    </li>
    <li>When gaiji is used to represent a new or made-up character that has no Unicode representation, use the phonetic hiragana or katakana string to represent the pronunciation of the new or made-up character. </li>
